# WaylandCraft

This is a (very) little mod that I use to run minecraft in Wayland compositors/DEs.

I mostly made it for personal reasons and does what I need it to, which is why most TODOs in the code aren't solved.

**If you want to contribute solving those issues and making this mod actually publishable, feel free!**

### Issues:
- No window decorations - we should roll out our own.
- funny behaviour when moving the game across monitors with different aspect ratios
- No game icon
- "game icon" on gnome Dash flashes frequently
